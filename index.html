          <h2>WHAT IS A PERFUME PYRAMID?</h2>
          <p>
            A perfume pyramid is an olfactory concept to visualise the
            composition of a fragrance. It has three layers: we find top notes
            at the tip of the pyramid, heart notes a layer down, and base notes
            underneath.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pyramid’s shape represents the way we experience perfume as it
            develops over the course of the day. First, we encounter light and
            refreshing top notes – fresh basil, perhaps, or zesty mandarin.
            Next, we experience a layer of heart notes, like florals. Over time,
            this layer then dries down to a heavier base – imagine woody or
            spicy scents. This is the perfume pyramid: its shape is a way to
            visualise the order in which we typically encounter a scent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pyramid is one illustration of a perfume’s architecture and
            evolution – though not all fragrances develop in this way. Many
            notes in the pyramid harmonise together: you may detect heart notes
            at the same time as the top notes – fresh florals like rose, for
            instance, may appear alongside the lighter profile of lavender.
            Equally, rich base notes – such as leathery oud or sandalwood – may
            also be present on opening, deepening as the scent dries down.

          <h2>WHAT ARE PERFUME NOTES?</h2>
          <p>
            Perfume notes are descriptors of scents, separated into three
            categories: top, heart and base notes. These three notes work
            together to create intricate layers that form a perfume’s unique
            character.
          </p>
          <p>
            All luxury fragrances are composed of different perfume notes – from
            the sweet symphonies of violet and iris to the sultry amber accents
            of musk and ambergris. Given the way these notes interact with one
            another to create a unique scent profile, it is perhaps unsurprising
            that perfumery is often described in musical terms: notice the way
            the scent’s notes harmonise, deepen and evolve on the skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            These three perfume notes are structured in the fragrance pyramid
            according to their qualities, such as their evaporation time and the
            order in which we typically encounter them. We have a whole page
            assigned to note ingredients in which you can find some interesting
            and informative articles.
