            Top notes, sometimes referred to as headnotes, form the top layer of
            a fragrance. In other words, top notes are the scents you detect
            first after spraying a perfume. These play a role in setting first
            impressions and shaping a fragrance’s story.

            As the name suggests, heart notes make up the “heart” of the
            fragrance. Their function is to retain some of the top notes’ aroma
            while also introducing new scents to deepen the experience.

            Along with middle notes, base notes in perfume form the foundation
            of the fragrance. They help boost the lighter notes while adding
            more depth and resonance.

          <h2 class="mt-4">TOP NOTES</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">
            Top notes usually evaporate quickly, lingering around for only the
            first five to fifteen minutes. Their main purpose is to give off an
            initial scent and then transition smoothly into the next part of the
            fragrance. As a result, top notes generally consist of lighter and
            smaller molecules. Some common top notes include citrus scents –
            like lemon, orange, and bergamot – as well as light floral scents
            like lavender and rose. Basil and anise are also commonly used as
            top notes. <strong>Fresh notes</strong> are light and citrusy in
            nature, making them popular as top notes. Notes like orange and
            bergamot give a fragrance its freshness and sweetness, while lemon
            and bergamot have a more bitter sharpness.
            <strong>Floral notes</strong>
            add a natural feel to a fragrance. They are often used as top or
            heart notes and can be mixed with other notes for a more dramatic
            scent. Jasmine is another popular floral note with its fruity and
            white floral scent, while ylang ylang adds a more tropical touch.

          <h2 class="mt-4">HEART NOTES</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">
            Sometimes referred to as middle notes, the heart notes also serve as
            a buffer for the base notes, which may not smell as pleasant on
            their own. Because they make up around 70 percent of the total
            scent, heart notes usually last longer than top notes. Heart notes
            appear as the top notes start to fade and remain evident for the
            full life of the fragrance. Heart notes include full-bodied,
            aromatic floral oils like jasmine, geranium, neroli and ylang-ylang,
            as well as cinnamon, pepper, pine, lemongrass, black pepper and
            cardamom. <strong>Fruity notes</strong> are most commonly used as
            middle notes, as they blend easily with other notes and can add more
            depth to a fragrance. For example, blackberry adds a rich, musky
            scent, while notes like apple and strawberry give off a sweet and
            juicy vibe. <strong>Spice notes</strong> are used to add warmth and
            potency to a fragrance, mixing particularly well with floral notes
            in the heart of a perfume. Notes like cinnamon and nutmeg add spice
            and sweetness, while others like rosemary and basil possess an
            herbal quality.

          <h2 class="mt-4">BASE NOTES</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">
            Since they form the perfume’s foundation, base notes are very rich,
            heavy and long-lasting fragrance notes. They kick in after about 30
            minutes and work together with the middle notes to create the
            fragrance’s scent. Since base notes sink into your skin, their scent
            lingers the longest and can last for six hours or more. Popular base
            notes include vanilla, amber, musk, patchouli, moss and woody notes
            like sandalwood and cedarwood. Sandalwood and patchouli are two
            <strong>wood notes</strong> that are often used in a fragrance’s
            base to strengthen the scent’s lifetime. While most wood notes have
            an earthy quality, some like cedarwood and oud provide a nice sweet
            scent. <strong>Musky notes</strong> are most frequently found in the
            base notes of fragrances. Their richness helps to fill in the
            foundation and increase the duration of the scent. The different
            types of musk, from black musk to cashmere musk, means that these
            scents can add a unique trait to any fragrance.

          <h2 class="mt-4">SUMMARY</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">
            In summary perfume notes are ingredients that make up a fragrance.
            They are categorized as top notes (citrus, lavendar) heart notes
            (cinnamon, jasmine) and base notes (vanilla, musk). This carefully
            selected blend of ingredients forms the perfume accord, the basic
            character of a fragrance. Perfume makers carefully select notes to
            make sure a fragrance both smells pleasant and evokes a certain
            experience. Notes are classified in a fragrance pyramid.
